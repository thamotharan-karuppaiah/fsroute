# FreshRoute - URL Rewriter & Header Modifier

A powerful Chrome extension for URL rewriting and header modification, similar to Requestly. This extension allows you to:

1. **URL Rewrite Rules**: Redirect URLs using regex patterns with capture groups
2. **Header Modification Rules**: Add, modify, or remove HTTP headers for requests and responses

## Features

### URL Rewriting
- Define source URL patterns using regex
- Map to target URLs with capture group substitution
- Support for complex regex patterns like `http://localhost.freshservice-dev.com:8080/(.*)` → `https://share-freshgladiators-m4008.freshgladiators.com/$1`

### Header Modification
- Add, override, append, or remove headers
- Separate control for request and response headers
- Regex-based URL pattern matching
- Support for CORS headers, authentication tokens, and custom headers

### Rule Management
- Individual rule enable/disable toggles
- Global extension enable/disable
- User-friendly interface with tabbed organization
- Real-time rule validation

### Cookie Access & Auto-Fill
- **Automatic Cookie Fetching**: Extract cookies from any domain for header rules
- **One-Click Cookie Population**: Automatically fill cookie values in preset configurations
- **Smart Cookie Management**: Access both domain and subdomain cookies
- **Freshservice Preset Integration**: Seamlessly fetch authentication cookies for development workflows

### URL Rewrite Examples

#### Basic Redirect
- **Source**: `http://localhost:3000/(.*)`
- **Target**: `https://myapp.com/$1`

#### Environment Switching
- **Source**: `https://staging\.example\.com/(.*)`
- **Target**: `https://production.example.com/$1`

#### API Endpoint Rewriting
- **Source**: `http://local-api\.dev:8080/api/v1/(.*)`
- **Target**: `https://api.production.com/v2/$1`

### Header Modification Examples

#### Add CORS Headers
- **URL Pattern**: `https://api\.example\.com/.*`
- **Headers**:
  - Name: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, Operation: Set, Target: Response, Value: `*`
  - Name: `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, Operation: Set, Target: Response, Value: `GET, POST, PUT, DELETE`

#### Remove Security Headers
- **URL Pattern**: `https://internal\.company\.com/.*`
- **Headers**:
  - Name: `X-Frame-Options`, Operation: Remove, Target: Response

#### Add Authentication
- **URL Pattern**: `https://secure\.api\.com/.*`
- **Headers**:
  - Name: `Authorization`, Operation: Set, Target: Request, Value: `Bearer your-token-here`

### Cookie Auto-Fill Feature

The extension can automatically fetch and fill cookies from any domain, making it easy to configure authentication headers for development environments.

#### Using Cookie Auto-Fill in Freshservice Preset

1. **Select Freshservice Preset**: Choose the Freshservice template when creating a new group
2. **Enter Target Domain**: Fill in your target domain (e.g., `infinity-share.freshinfinitysquad.com`)
3. **Auto-Fill Cookies**: Click the "🍪 Fetch Cookies" button next to the Cookie Value field
4. **Automatic Population**: The extension will:
   - Extract all cookies from the target domain
   - Format them as a proper Cookie header value
   - Display a summary of fetched cookies
   - Fill the Cookie Value field automatically

#### Manual Cookie Management

You can also use cookie functionality in custom header rules:
1. **Create Header Rule**: Add a new header modification rule
2. **Set URL Pattern**: Define which URLs should receive the cookies
3. **Add Cookie Header**: 
   - Name: `Cookie`
   - Operation: Set
   - Target: Request
   - Value: Use the fetch cookies feature or enter manually

#### Cookie Security & Privacy

- **Local Processing**: All cookie data is processed locally within the extension
- **Domain-Specific**: Only cookies from the specified domain are accessed
- **No External Transmission**: Cookie data never leaves your browser
- **User Consent**: Cookie access only occurs when explicitly requested by the user

## Advanced Features

### Regex Patterns
The extension supports full JavaScript regex patterns:
- Use parentheses `()` for capture groups
- Reference capture groups with `$1`, `$2`, etc.
- Use `.*` for wildcard matching
- Escape special characters with backslashes

### Pattern Examples
- `https://([^.]+)\.example\.com/(.*)` → `https://newdomain.com/$1/$2`
- `http://localhost:(\d+)/(.*)` → `https://remote-server.com:$1/$2`

### Header Operations
- **Set/Override**: Replaces existing header or adds if not present
- **Append**: Adds to existing header value (comma-separated)
- **Remove**: Completely removes the header

## Permissions

The extension requires the following permissions:
- `declarativeNetRequest`: For URL rewriting and header modification

- `cookies`: For accessing and reading cookies from websites (used in preset configurations)
- `<all_urls>`: Host permission for all websites

## Troubleshooting

### Rules Not Working
1. Check if the extension is enabled (toggle in popup)
2. Verify that individual rules are enabled
3. Test regex patterns in a regex tester
4. Check browser console for errors

### Performance Issues
- Limit the number of active rules
- Use specific URL patterns instead of wildcards when possible
- Disable unused rules

### Debugging
1. Open Chrome DevTools
2. Go to the Network tab
3. Check if requests are being modified as expected
4. Look at the Console tab for any error messages
